        <h2>This is the Home Page</h2>
        <p>The types of things you should expect on this website are not flashy. I am a semibeginner in the coding industry. I find it interesting that people do this as a job which is why I decided to pursue it as a career. You will find out information about me, my hobbies, my interest, and my resume. I like to say that I am no average Joe, and that I like to work efficiently in whatever I am specialized in. This is my first time realistically creating a website, so it will not be the best. I am learning as I go on. Thank you for taking the time to look at my website.</p>
