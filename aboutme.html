<p> My name is Andrew, and I am Hispanic. I have a lot of nicknames that my friends call me. Some of them are: Drew, Drewski, Andy, and Ayala. Recently, I have been going by the name "Drew." I am 19 years old, and I am a sophomore at Blue Mountain Christian University. I am a collegiate athelete, and my main sport is cross country and middle distance track. My major is computer science, and so far, I am liking it a lot. I was previously a business major, but I switched it up because I had trouble with it. I do business as a minor now. I am also the first in my family to attend a college and compete in sports.</p>


<h2>My Hobbies & Interest</h2>
<p> I also want to share that I have an interest for music. Very recently, I have been listening to classical music. Whenever I was younger, I always thought that classical music was for weirdos. However, as time passed, I came to reaize how good classical music can be. I have been listening to it for the past couple of years. I must say that it is very soothing. Especially when I am studying. It really helps me. Another genre that I like, and have been listening to recently is soft pop and pop. I started listening to this because I was getting tired of listening to what I usually listened to (Rap), and I just wanted to expand my horizons. Rap is another genre that I listen to. I mainly listen to it whenever I work out, prepare for a race, or sometimes I would even turn it on during a run.</p>

<p style="color:aliceblue;"> So, about a few years ago, I had come to a realization that one of my favorite hobbies I enjoy doing is cooking. It did not take me long to realize that I have a passion for cooking. It started when I was the age of 14 or 15 so it has been a few years. Whenever I cooked with my mother, we would always talk about things, and I would be happy. We have the best conversations. That is one of the reasons I enjoy doing it. Another reason is becuase I just love knowing that I have the ability to make food. I have been blessed with the skill of making food.</p>
